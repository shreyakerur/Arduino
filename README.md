# Arduino
This is a Project I have implemented called "Automatic Visitor Counter with Light Control" which is configured using Arduino IDE software.
The vision of the project is to conserve energy i.e., since we tend to forget turning off the lights, fan or other electronic components, it contributes to wastage of energy and resources. Thus, this project is implemented keeping in mind the ultimate to provide "Home Automation" facility after integrating IoT based configurations. As of now, it is in an incubation mode where we, as Second Year students, are trying to understand the basics of electronics and the real world problems while building it. Even if it is a basic model of our idea, it's accuracy is amazing. So here's the code we used to configure the microcontroller(in the counter file).
